An incomplete rewriting of my xas_normalisation repository to C++ as an exercise for myself. Currently does file splitting/ column selection and regridding, and does run a bit faster, but does not do the normalisation. 

Requires the argParserCPP module. To use do 'git clone --recurse-submodules' to get.
